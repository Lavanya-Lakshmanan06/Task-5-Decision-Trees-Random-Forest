# Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests 🌳🌲

## 🔍 Objective
To explore tree-based machine learning models — Decision Trees and Random Forests — using the Heart Disease Dataset.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Graphviz

## 📊 Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Cleaned and split the Heart Disease dataset.
2. **Decision Tree Classifier**
   - Trained and visualized a decision tree.
   - Controlled overfitting by limiting tree depth.
3. **Random Forest Classifier**
   - Trained and compared accuracy with the decision tree.
   - Interpreted feature importance visually.
4. **Cross-Validation**
   - Evaluated both models using 5-fold CV.

## 📈 Results
- Random Forest gave higher and more stable accuracy.
- Key features: `cp`, `thalach`, and `ca`.
